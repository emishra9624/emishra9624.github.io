                <p>Throughout my undergraduate studies, I had been lucky enough to work at the University of Toronto's <a href="https://mishra-lab.ca/ekta-mishra/"> Mishra Lab for Mathematical Modelling </a> under the supervision of Drs. Sharmistha Mishra and Jesse Knight. Together, we examined progress on the UNAIDS' 'first 90 goal' (to have 90% of those living with HIV know their status) among Female Sex Workers living with HIV across Sub-Saharan Africa. </p>
                <p>It was at the Mishra Lab that I first experienced the power of research as a tool for advocacy. Since then, I have focused my research on health economics issues, to understand better how systemic change may improve equitable access to care. I began working with Dr. Michel Grignon on two projects.</p>
                <p>First, we are examining William Baumol's 'cost disease' in the healthcare systems of OECD countries across Europe and North America. The accurate diagnosis of this macroeconomic disease could explain rising healthcare costs in rich countries. </p>
                <p>Second, under the supervision of Drs. Michel Grignon and Byron Spencer, I am conducting a retrospective examination of mortality trends in Canada, using the age-period-cohorts model. This project is funded by an <a href="https://artsci.mcmaster.ca/current-students/undergraduate-student-research-award-usra/"> Undergraduate Student Research Award</a>. </p>
